Files in this directory are prepared for easy development environment in Windows environments. All you have to do is copy openocd.exe file to the directory listed on your PATH, so it can be run in Makefiles without providing full path for the file. Rest of the files are portable and complete so, run without install.

Open Makefile with MiniIDE.exe then, you are ready to go. Double-click on the file name in the file tree will bring up SciTE editor with the file. Resize the MiniIDE.exe vertically narrow for your convenience.

With main.c open up in the editor, you can 'Compile', 'Build', 'Flash download', 'Reset target', and 'Clean up'. MiniIDE.exe keeps the SciTE editor alined side by side most of the time. By adjusting the height of MiniIDE window, you can adjust the height of the editor.
